convnet.js python port with examples

convnet.js is a neural network library that works really well in a browser with a simple API.

I wanted to play with the source to learn about how it worked, and I figured the best way was to port it to python.

Check out the original convent.js repo: [https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs](https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs)

and example that got me excited about it: [http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html)
